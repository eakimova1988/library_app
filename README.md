![https://travis-ci.org/jaysoo/todomvc-redux-react-typescript](https://api.travis-ci.org/jaysoo/todomvc-redux-react-typescript.svg)

This is an implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) built using:

- [React & ReactDOM](http://facebook.github.io/react/) 0.14.7
- [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) 3.0.6

It is adapted from the [redux TodoMVC example](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc).

Read more about it in my blog post: http://jaysoo.ca/2015/09/26/typed-react-and-redux/
